    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Fiction is very sentimental at times. So Sentiment might be a good Feature to extract in order to learn the Genre. For example Love and Romance storys are expected to have strong sentiments, as they normally include a lot of positive and negative feelings. Generally positive, negative and neutral Sentiment can be extracted, to give a more complex view on the feelings and opinions occuring in the Story. In order to extract Sentiment we will make some simplyfying assumtpions. Firstly we will assume, that sentiment can be measured on the word Level. So no structual information of any longer Sequences of Text will be used, apart from negations that will be assingend to all words in a sentence, following some negationing adjective. To achieve this nltk's toolkit for Sentiment analysis will be used[1]. In order to assign Sentiments to each word the sentiwordnet database will be used[2]. Here it will be assumed, that the sentiment of the most common usage of a word is sufficiant to derive overall sentiment. In order to keep it simple sentiment will only be derived from all nouns, verbs and adjectives and crunched in one number per dimension (positive, negative, neutral) by averaging over all sentences in the document. This might be very restrictive because some word-types might even out the sentiment of other word types, but it should still somehow measure the concept. Also the Average is only computed using half of the sentences of each Document for efficiency reasons. \n",

    "Nowadays a lot of the Gender differences in interests are vanishing, but still there is some predictive power of gender for personal interests[1]. In the 19th Century this was propably also the case. Presumably correlation of gender and interests was even stronger, as Gender equality was not achieved to a high extend. So extracting Gender orientation of texts might be a valid approach to classify genre in our dataset. We assume that gender orientation can be measured by comparing the usage of gender-specific Pronouns. We will therefor simply count all the male and female-specific pronouns and derive two Features from that by dividing with the total Number of Words per Document. Dividing is necessary to avoid high correlation with Number of Words. The Extraction of These features is achieved by using simple nltk methods and pure Python. \n",

    "The derived Sentiment Features are in a range of really low values (between 0.0 and 0.2). This is due to the high number of words that don't have sentiment to them. Those words dominate the mean calculation. The standarddeviation is therefore also in a low order of magnitude (~0.01 for all three Features). It seems, that the differnces are not very big, and a rather low predictive Power is assumed. Observing the Histogramms, the Features seem to be normally distributed. If running an Anova, significant results for the Target variable are obtained. This means, that the means of the Sentiment variabes are dependent on the genre. To avoid completely imbalanced samples, the genres with less than 18 cases were comibined in to the genre \"other\" before running the anova. So the Sentiment Variables will be included in the final model. "

    "The summary statistics for Gender-Orientation confirm some previous Hypothesis. The mean male orientation is higher than the mean female orientation, but at the same time the variance is higher for female orientation. We can see, in the Histogramms, that the Distribution for Male Orientaion seems gaussian, while Female Orientation has a longer tail on the right sight. Some Documents must be highly female oriented, while in other documents females are rare. Male orientation is on a steady high level. The Anova confirms that female orientation has a high predictive power for the genre, while male orintation doesn't. "
